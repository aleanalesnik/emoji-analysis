		p.text-middle To measure emotion using emojis, we categorized basic human emotions into three classifications: Positive, Negative and Neutral. Then, made a data set of emojis that fit into each category based on academic findings. Once a user enters an inquiry in the search, our algorithm gets to work! The final result will be a data visualization showing the percentage of positive, negative and nuetral sentiment of the user’s inquiry.

		h5.faqheading Why use Emojis to calculate emotion?
			.emoji 🙄❓
		p.text-middle Commonly used in many tweets, Emojis are a scientifically-proven and reliable reflection of human emotion. They directly express one’s emotions regardless of language, and for that reason they have become a powerful indicator for sentiment analysis. Emojis are also not restricted by language, meaning our research can be broadened to any person using Twitter, which we think is pretty awesome.

		p.text-middle Yes. As of right now, we are only applying our algorithm for Twitter hashtags. The company is a centerpiece for publishing opinions and expressing emotions worldwide. With an average of 330 million monthly active users, the microblogging service is a rich source of data for emotion analysis. Most importantly, the brevity of the tweets teaches people to express themselves in as little words as possible.
