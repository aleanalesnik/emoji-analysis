				| To measure emotion using emojis, we categorized basic human emotions into three classifications: <em>Positive</em>, <em>Negative</em> and <em>Neutral</em>. Then, made a data set of emojis that fit into each category based on academic findings. Once a user enters an inquiry in the search, our algorithm gets to work! The final result will be a data visualization showing the percentage of positive, negative and nuetral sentiment of the user‚Äôs inquiry.
